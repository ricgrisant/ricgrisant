### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ricardo Grijalva

I'm a software developer passionate about web technologies, I also love the first step in the making of an app, analysis, and design.

As a developer, I am excited to learn new technologies and put all my effort to make sure that what I do surpass people's expectations, I also enjoy been challenged with works that make me feel uncomfortable to grow as a developer and professional in this constantly changing industry.
